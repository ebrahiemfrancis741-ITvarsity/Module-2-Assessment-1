                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gorillas are herbivorous, ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
                        The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four 
                        or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what 
                        is included. Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, 
                        weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to 
                        live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Gorillas are gentle giants and display many human-like behaviors and emotions, such as laughter and sadness.
                    </p>

                    <p>They play a crucial role in local biodiversity, roaming through large territories and helping to spread 
                        the seeds of the fruit they consume.
