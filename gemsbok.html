                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>
                        The gemsbok, also known as the South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. 
                        It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and parts of Zimbabwe, 
                        mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts.
                    </p>

                    <p>Gemsbok are powerfully built, with sturdy, muscular bodies, and are known for their striking coloration, 
                        being gray-brown with contrasting black and white markings on the face and legs, and a long black tail. 
                        They also have remarkable horns, which are long, straight, and backward-pointing.</p>

                    <p>
                        The gemsbok is the largest and best-known of the four species of oryx, or straight-horned antelope, 
                        and they are not the only oryx in Africa.
