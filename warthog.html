                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>
                        Their scientific name is Phacochoerus Africanus also known as the common warthog. Their name 
                        comes from their ‘warts’ or protrusions on the sides of their face, these protrusions are a 
                        combination of bone and cartilage.  It protects their face when they fight.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They sleep underground at night in burrows that they steal from other animals such as aardvark. 
                        They don’t dig their own.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Warthogs mainly eat grass or will dig for roots and bulbs when it’s dry. If they have the opportunity, 
                        they will scavenge on meat as they are omnivorous.
                    </p>
