                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>
                        Monkeys are primates, like humans. Primates have bigger brains than the rest of their bodies, 
                        which accounts for their higher intelligence. This is why monkeys are said to be smarter than most 
                        other primates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most world monkeys live in tropical regions. New World monkeys can be found close to the Amazon 
                        rainforest, while Old World monkeys live in rainforests, savannas, and mountains in Asia and Africa.

                    <p>
                        Did you know that a group of world monkeys is called a troop? Troops live and travel together in search of food. 
                        Traveling in troops also protects them from predators.

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
