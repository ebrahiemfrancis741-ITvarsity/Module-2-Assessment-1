                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>
                        At an average height of around 5 m (16-18 ft.), the giraffe is the tallest land animal in the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Characterized by its long legs, long neck, and distinctive spotted pattern, many people first believed the 
                        giraffe was a cross between a leopard and a camel, which is reflected in its scientific name, Giraffa camelopardalis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Giraffes live primarily in savanna areas in the sub-Saharan region of Africa. 
                        Their extreme height allows them to eat leaves and shoots located much higher than other animals can 
                        reach. In particular, they seek out acacia trees. Their long tongues are helpful in eating because they 
                        help pull leaves from the trees. Spending most of the day eating, a full-grown giraffe consumes over 
                        45 kg (100 lb.) of leaves and twigs a day.
