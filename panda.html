                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>
                        The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and 
                        communication. Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in 
                        snowy habitats. The arms and legs are black, helping it to hide in shade.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month - 
                        with the cub resting on her front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Giant pandas are good swimmers and excellent tree climbers. At 5 months old, 
                        giant panda cubs learn how to climb - sometimes practising by climbing on their mum.
